# You do not need Docker to run Lific. The project ships as a single binary
# with SQLite bundled (see the README for install options). This Dockerfile
# exists because MCP directory indexers (Glama and friends) build servers from
# a Dockerfile to verify them before listing; without one, Lific is invisible
# in their search. It also works fine if a container is genuinely how you want
# to deploy.

#   docker build -t lific .
#   docker run -p 3456:3456 -v lific-data:/data lific

# The database lives at /data/lific.db; mount a volume there to persist it.

# Stage 1: web UI, embedded into the binary via rust-embed.
# vite reads ../Cargo.toml for the version, so it's copied alongside.

# packages are needed; the stock slim image's C toolchain is enough. The

# links a newer glibc than the runtime ships.
