/** Recovering from a "recent authentication required" refusal.
 *
 *  A handful of actions mint something durable: an API key, a connected tool's
 *  credential, a new account, an admin grant. The server refuses those unless
 *  the browser session was authenticated in the last 15 minutes, because a
 *  session token lifted from a tab that signed in last week must not be enough
 *  to leave lasting access behind.
 *
 *  That refusal is correct and also, on its own, a dead end: the tab is signed
 *  in, the button does nothing, and the message does not say what to do. This
 *  module is the other half. It obtains a fresh session and hands the caller
 *  one retry, and it is deliberately small: no modal framework, no generic
 *  interceptor, no retry loop. Callers own their own UI and call these two
 *  functions.
