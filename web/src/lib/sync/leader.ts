// LIF-443: one websocket per browser, not one per tab.
//
// Ten open Lific tabs used to mean ten websockets, ten resume replays and
// ten copies of every event the server pushed. This module elects a single
// leader tab per origin, gives only that tab a socket, and fans the traffic
// out to the rest over a BroadcastChannel.
//
// ── Election ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The Web Locks API does the whole job. Every connected tab asks for the
// same exclusive lock, `lific-sync`, and the callback returns a promise the
// module never resolves while it is connected. The browser grants the lock
// to exactly one tab and queues the others; the holder keeps it for the
// lifetime of the tab. When that tab closes, crashes, or logs out, the lock
// is released and the browser hands it to the next waiter, which opens a
// socket and takes over. There is no heartbeat, no timeout, no tie-break:
// the lock manager is the source of truth and it is crash-safe by
// construction.
//
// The lock name is instance-wide, not per-project, because the socket is
// instance-scoped: one connection carries every project's events.
//
// ── Duplicate tolerance (why the fan-out is safe) ───────────
//
// Followers can and do send outbound frames, most importantly the `resume`
// frame their own read model needs after a promotion. Those frames go over
// the channel and the leader forwards them, so the server may replay the
// same range more than once and every tab sees the replay, not just the tab
// that asked. That is harmless: realtime envelopes never advance a read
// model's cursor (see readModel.svelte.ts), so a replayed event whose `seq`
// is at or below the cursor is dropped, and anything above it collapses
// into the same debounced `/changes?since=cursor` pull the model would have
// issued anyway. Duplicates cost a pull that returns nothing.
//
// ── Fallback ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Without `navigator.locks` (or `BroadcastChannel`) there is no election
// and no channel: every tab is its own leader with its own socket, exactly
// the behaviour that shipped before this module existed. `shared` is false,
// `leader` is true from construction, `post()` is a no-op, and every code
// path below collapses to "open a socket, hand its events to the caller".
