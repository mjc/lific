// LIF-442: wire types for the delta-sync read surface (server: LIF-439).
//
// These mirror `src/db/models.rs`'s `IssueChange` / `PageChange` /
// `CommentChange` / `Tombstone` exactly. Every row is *skinny*: identity,
// its position in the project's sync stream (`seq`), and the fields a list
// or board renders. Full descriptions, page content and comment bodies are
// deliberately absent — a detail view fetches those. Issue and page rows do
// carry a bounded `preview`, which is what a list row actually renders.
//
// `seq` is a per-project monotonic stream position. A client's `cursor` is
// the highest seq it has applied; `/changes?since=cursor` returns everything
// above it, tombstones included.
