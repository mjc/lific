// LIF-442: skinny sync rows → the `Issue` shape the list/board components
// already speak.
//
// The list surfaces are built around `api.Issue`. Rather than retype every
// row component, card, comparator and grouping helper against a second
// issue type, the read model's rows are adapted into that shape at the one
// boundary where they enter a route.
//
// Three fields are reconstructed:
//
//  * `project_id` — the model knows it; it is the project it replicates.
//  * `sequence`   — the trailing number of the identifier (`LIF-442` → 442),
//                   which is exactly what the server derives it from. The
//                   "number" sort depends on it.
//  * `description` — the row's `preview`, NOT the document. `/index` and
//                   `/changes` ship skinny rows on purpose, so a cold start
//                   costs one round trip proportional to the row count
//                   rather than to every word in the project; what they do
//                   carry is the first non-empty line of the body, capped
//                   at 200 characters. That is exactly what the two
//                   consumers of this field on a list surface want: the
//                   comfortable-density preview line in `IssueRow`, and
//                   `computeSearchResult`'s body scoring and snippets.
//                   Both degrade honestly — a match past the first line is
//                   missed rather than mis-rendered. Anything that needs
//                   the real document (the editor, the peek panel) fetches
//                   the issue.
//
// Adapted objects are memoized per row. A row object is only replaced when
// the server actually sent a newer version of it, so an unchanged issue
// keeps its identity across a delta and every `{#each ... (issue.id)}` and
// `animate:flip` in the list stays still.
