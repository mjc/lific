// Per-project "last seen" snapshot for the issue list (LIF-153).
//
// The list already background-polls every 15 seconds and swaps rows in
// silently, so an issue an agent touched two minutes ago looks exactly like
// one nobody has touched in a month. This module stores, per project, the
// `updated_at` each issue carried the last time the user actually looked at
// it. Anything whose current `updated_at` is newer than its stored value
// (or which has no stored value at all, i.e. it was created since) counts as
// changed, and the list marks it.
//
// Shape (one localStorage key per project, `lific:seen:<identifier>`):
//
//   { "41": "2026-08-16T18:22:03Z", "57": "2026-08-14T09:10:00Z" }
//
// Keys are issue ids as strings, because JSON object keys always are;
// storing them that way keeps the round trip lossless instead of quietly
// changing type on reload. Values are the raw `updated_at` strings straight off the
// API; they're ISO-8601, so a plain lexicographic compare orders them
// correctly (the same assumption `sort.ts` and the Recent sub-tab already
// make with `localeCompare`).
//
// Everything here is pure + storage-only, deliberately mirroring
// `issues/persistence.ts`: the reactive half lives in the component that
// owns the issue data. Every accessor swallows storage errors (private
// mode / quota) so a failed write degrades to in-memory behavior rather
// than breaking the list.
