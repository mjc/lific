// LIF-283 — deferred issue deletion with an Undo toast.
//
// Deletes are the one destructive action in the UI with no recovery. This
// module makes issue deletes *optimistic + deferred*: the caller removes the
// rows from its local state immediately (so the UI feels instant), we show a
// "Deleted N issue(s)" toast with an Undo action, and the actual DELETE API
// call(s) only fire once that toast closes without Undo being pressed.
//
//   - Undo pressed        → cancel, call `onRestore`, never touch the API.
//   - Toast expires/closed → commit: fire the DELETE(s); on failure, toast an
//                            error and call `onRestore` so nothing is lost.
//   - Page hide / nav away → flush synchronously via keepalive fetch so
//                            closing the tab can't silently cancel the delete.
//
// Only ONE batch is pending at a time. Scheduling a new batch first flushes
// (commits) any outstanding one — this keeps the mental model and the flush
// path simple, and matches how a user thinks ("I deleted these, then those").
//
// The module owns *timing and the API*; the caller owns *local state* (it did
// the optimistic removal and provides `onRestore` to put rows back). Restore
// callbacks capture plain issue objects, never live component state, so Undo
// keeps working even after the originating component has unmounted (same
// discipline as state.svelte.ts's update-undo layer).
