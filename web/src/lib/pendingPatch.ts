/** Parking a settings patch that was refused for a stale sign-in.
 *
 *  Instance settings autosave per field, and a refusal parks the patch in a
 *  single "what is waiting for confirmation" slot. Anything the save queue
 *  drains afterwards would overwrite that slot, so the prompt would confirm
 *  whichever field was touched *last* and silently drop the earlier one. The
 *  admin sees both controls showing their new values and only one of them
 *  actually saves.
 *
 *  So once a patch is parked, later ones merge into it instead of being sent.
 *  One prompt, one replay, covering everything that was asked for.
 *
 *  Kept here as plain functions so the rule is testable without a DOM, and so
 *  the component is left holding state rather than logic.
