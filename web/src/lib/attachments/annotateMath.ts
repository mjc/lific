// LIF-418: pure geometry + history helpers behind the screenshot annotator.
//
// AnnotateDialog.svelte owns the canvas and the pointer plumbing; every
// calculation it needs that can be reasoned about without a DOM lives here so
// it can be unit-tested directly (web/tests/annotateMath.test.ts).
//
// Coordinate convention: shapes are stored in *image* space (natural pixels of
// the source screenshot), never in CSS pixels. The canvas is displayed at some
// fit-to-viewport scale and pointer positions are divided by that scale on the
// way in. Keeping the model in image space means the flattened export is
// pixel-exact at full resolution regardless of the window size at edit time.
