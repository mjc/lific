// LIF-418: alt text for freshly inserted image references.
//
// An upload inserts `![name.png](/api/attachments/12)` at the caret. The
// filename is a placeholder, not a description: screen readers announce
// "Screenshot 2026-08-17 at 14.02.11.png" and nobody is better off. After a
// successful image upload the pending chip offers a one-line input, and what
// gets typed there is spliced into the alt slot of that reference by the pure
// function below.
//
// Pure on purpose: the composer owns the draft string, this file owns the
// splice, and neither needs the other's state to be tested.

/**
 * Make a raw input string safe to sit inside `![...]`.
 *
 * Newlines would break the reference across lines and unbalanced brackets
 * would terminate the alt early, turning the rest of the description into
 * literal text next to a broken image. Both are folded rather than rejected so
 * a paste of multi-line text still produces something usable.
