// LIF-268 / LIF-418: shared pending-upload state for every markdown composer.
//
// `compose.ts` owns the pure helpers (markdownFor, insertSnippetAt,
// filesFromClipboard/Drop). This module owns the stateful layer every composer
// shares, so drag, paste, the Attach button and the new-issue form can never
// fork behaviour: a reactive list of outstanding uploads, each rendered as a
// chip by `PendingUploads.svelte`.
//
// LIF-418 reworked the transfer itself. It used to be strictly sequential over
// fetch, with a spinner and no idea how far along anything was. Now:
//
//   * up to MAX_IN_FLIGHT transfers run at once (see queue.ts), so a six
//     screenshot drop starts immediately instead of trickling;
//   * every chip carries byte-level progress from XMLHttpRequest, because
//     fetch still cannot report upload progress;
//   * every chip can be canceled mid-flight, and every failure can be retried
//     in place;
//   * an image that is enormous, or close to the instance's byte cap, pauses
//     on the chip and offers a resize first (see downscale.ts).
//
// One upload moves through: (annotate) -> (offer) -> queued -> uploading ->
// success (chip drops, or lingers to ask for alt text) or error (chip turns
// red with the server reason plus Retry / Dismiss). Image files carry a
// `previewUrl` object URL that is revoked the moment the chip leaves, so a
// long-lived composer never leaks blob URLs.
//
// Two of those steps come from the capture work. Annotation runs *before*
// anything enters the queue, because drawing on a screenshot changes its bytes
// and the resize question can only be asked about the bytes we will really
// send. Alt text runs *after* a successful image upload, on a chip that is
// already settled: nothing is in flight, and ignoring it costs nothing.
//
// Because it uses runes it lives in a `.svelte.ts` module.
