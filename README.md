  <strong>Issue tracking for the agentic coding era.</strong><br>
  One binary. One SQLite database (plus an attachments dir). MCP built in.
</p>

---

Your agent can write the code. What it can't do is remember: the plan dies with the context window, the TODO list rots in a markdown file, and the next session starts from zero. Lific is the missing memory: a self-hosted, single-binary issue tracker whose primary user is often an agent rather than a person.

Three numbers instead of adjectives:

- **29 MCP tools in 6,081 tokens.** That's the measured size of the full `tools/list` response at v2.0.0 (o200k tokenizer). Your entire tracker costs about as much context as one long file read. Bloated MCP servers are a real tax; this one isn't.
- **One ~25 MB binary.** Embedded SQLite, embedded web UI, backups built in. The data set is just the database and a content-addressed `attachments/` dir beside it (both covered by the automatic backups). No Docker, no Postgres, no reverse proxy, no daemon farm. Copy it to a server, point your agents at it, done.
- **11 AI clients configured by one command.** `lific connect` writes correct MCP config into OpenCode, Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Codex, Zed, and more. No hand-edited JSON.

Identifiers are human-readable everywhere: `APP-42`, never a UUID. They survive being spoken, logged, grepped, and pasted into a prompt.

## 60-second setup

```bash
cargo install lific     # or grab a binary from the releases page

lific init              # config + database + your API key, printed once -
                        # then installs a background service and starts it.
                        # The server is now on :3456 and survives reboot.
lific connect           # writes MCP config into your AI clients
```

That's the whole thing. `lific init` sets everything up in your OS's standard locations (config in `~/.config/lific/`, data in `~/.local/share/lific/` on Linux; macOS and Windows equivalents) so it works the same from any directory - use `lific init --here` if you'd rather keep a directory-local instance (`./lific.toml` + `./lific.db`). It registers the server with your OS service manager (a systemd user unit on Linux, a LaunchAgent on macOS), so it isn't a process tied to your terminal - it's still running tomorrow. `lific connect` then detects the AI tools installed on your machine, lets you pick, mints a per-tool API key, and merges correct MCP config into each one without overwriting existing config. Restart your client and the Lific tools are there.

Manage the service anytime with `lific service status | restart | stop | uninstall`. Prefer a foreground process (containers, supervisors, debugging)? `lific init --no-service` skips the service and `lific start` runs the server in your terminal.

The web UI is at `http://localhost:3456`. Sign up there to create your account, then grant it admin rights from the CLI: `lific user promote --username <username>`.

Verify any setup with:

```bash
lific doctor            # green/yellow/red checks: config, database, server,
                        # OAuth discovery, and a real MCP round-trip
```

`doctor` exits nonzero if anything is actually broken, so agents and CI can gate on it.

## What your agent can now do

- **Ask "what can I work on right now?" in one call.** `list_issues(project="APP", workable=true)` returns only issues with every blocker resolved. Dependency-aware triage without a graph query.
- **Keep a plan alive across sessions.** Plans are persistent, nestable step trees. A fresh session calls `get_plan` and resumes exactly where the last one left off. No `MEMORY.md`, no re-priming ritual.
- **Break work down and wire it up.** Create issues, link blockers (`blocks`, `relates_to`, `duplicate`), group them into modules, and mirror plan steps to real issues with two-way done/close sync.
- **Leave a real audit trail.** `get_activity` answers "what changed while I was gone": who changed what, when, and through which tool. Every agent's work is attributed (more below).
- **Write docs where the issues live.** Markdown pages in folders, with comments, labels, lifecycle status, and Mermaid diagrams. Design decisions stay next to the work they justify.
- **Edit without resending.** `edit_issue` / `edit_page` do targeted find-and-replace, so updating one line of a long description doesn't cost the whole document in tokens.
- **Take everything with you.** `export_issue`, `export_page`, `export_project`: portable markdown, no lock-in.

## Every tool gets its own identity, and that's the point

`lific connect` mints a **separate bot identity per tool**, owned by your account (`opencode-blake`, `cursor-blake`, ...). When several agents work the same project, provenance is the primitive that keeps you sane:

- **The audit log shows which harness made every change.** "OpenCode closed APP-42", "Cursor edited the design page". All attributed to you, never blurred together.
- **Revoke one tool without touching the others.** Cursor misbehaving? Disconnect just its key and OpenCode keeps working.
- **Scoped authority.** Each bot inherits its owner's project access and nothing more.

This is the recommended way to connect agent harnesses.

## Connecting AI tools

**`lific connect`** is the front door. It supports eleven clients out of the box:

`opencode` · `claude-code` · `claude-desktop` · `cursor` · `vscode` · `codex` · `zed` · `gemini` · `windsurf` · `goose` · `crush`

```bash
lific connect                                    # interactive picker
lific connect --client opencode --client cursor --yes   # non-interactive
lific connect --client claude-code --scope project      # repo-local .mcp.json
lific connect --client zed --stdio               # no server: direct SQLite over stdio
lific connect --dry-run --client vscode          # preview without writing
```

Each client gets its native schema (`mcpServers` vs `servers` vs `mcp`, Codex TOML with an env-var token, Goose YAML; the quirks are handled). JSON configs are merged non-destructively; a file `connect` can't parse safely is left untouched and you get the exact snippet to paste instead.

<details>
<summary>OAuth, if you'd rather auth as yourself</summary>

Lific implements the full MCP authorization spec (RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata, dynamic client registration, PKCE), so OAuth-capable clients can connect with **just the URL** and complete auth in the browser:

```bash
lific connect --oauth --client opencode   # writes a header-less config, mints nothing
opencode mcp auth lific                   # browser opens → sign in → approve

# or with any client's native command:
claude mcp add --transport http lific http://localhost:3456/mcp
```

The trade-off: an OAuth token **is you**. Changes made through it are indistinguishable from your own edits in the audit log, with no per-harness attribution. Fine for personally browsing your tracker from an editor; for agents doing real work, prefer the per-tool bot identities above.

**Headless / SSH / agents.** No browser on the box? The device flow has you covered:

```bash
lific login                     # prints a URL + short code; approve on any device
lific login --non-interactive   # agent mode: prints JSON {verification_uri, user_code,
                                #   device_code, next_step} and exits immediately
lific login --complete <code>   # finish later, from a script or a second session
```

Tokens are stored in your OS keyring (Secret Service / Keychain / Credential Manager), falling back to a `0600` file with a loud warning when no keyring exists.

<details>
<summary>Manual configuration (any MCP client)</summary>

**Remote (Streamable HTTP):**

```json
{
  "lific": {
    "type": "remote",
    "url": "http://localhost:3456/mcp",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key" }
  }
}
```

**Local (stdio, no server):**

```json
{
  "lific": {
    "type": "local",
    "command": ["lific", "--db", "path/to/lific.db", "mcp"]
  }
}
```

Create keys anytime with `lific key create --name my-key`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Web UI setup (if you prefer clicking)</summary>

Go to **Settings > Connected tools** in the web UI. Pick your tool, click Connect, and paste the generated config snippet.

Each connection creates a bot identity tied to your account (the CLI's `connect` does the same). Changes show up attributed to you, tagged with which tool made them.

</details>

## Plans: state that outlives the session

An agent's plan shouldn't die when its context does. A **plan** is an ordered, arbitrarily-nestable tree of steps that persists across sessions and compaction. Start a new session, call `get_plan`, and it's still there, ready to resume.

- **Steps can mirror issues.** Link a step to an issue and the two stay in sync: close the issue and the step checks itself; mark the step done and the issue closes. Reopen the issue and the step reopens, with a note of why.
- **Authored in one call.** `create_plan` builds a full nested tree at once; `edit_plan_step` and `update_plan_step` keep it current.
- **First-class in the UI.** A Plans tab sits alongside Issues, Board, Modules, and Pages: a real tree view with done toggles, per-step markdown notes, issue chips, and an activity timeline.
- **Fully tracked.** Every plan and step change lands in the audit log, including the issue-driven cascades.

Issues stay flat and lateral; the hierarchy lives on the plan. It's the difference between an issue tracker and a project planner.

## Built for agents, not just reachable by them

- **`lific agents-md`** writes an idempotent, marker-delimited block into your repo's `AGENTS.md` telling every agent that this project uses Lific: project identifier, CLI examples, and the workflow conventions. `lific connect` offers to do this automatically in project context.
- **Session instructions.** The MCP server ships its conventions in the `initialize` response, so connected agents know how Lific wants to be used without you explaining it.
- **Self-onboarding.** On a fresh database, the MCP tools tell the agent exactly how to bootstrap (`create a project first: manage_resource(...)`) instead of returning an empty list.
- **Pipe-native CLI.** Output auto-upgrades to JSON when piped, so `lific issue list --project APP | jq` just works, no `--json` needed (though it's there). Prompts never hang a non-interactive caller; they fail fast and name the bypass flag.
- **Shell completions:** `lific completion fish | source` (bash, zsh, fish, powershell, elvish).

The CLI also works directly against the database, no server or auth required:

```bash
lific project list
lific issue list --project APP
lific issue create --project APP --title "Fix login bug" --priority high
lific issue update APP-42 --status done
lific search "authentication" --project APP
```

## MCP tools

All 29, in 6,081 tokens:

| Family | Tools |
|--------|-------|
| Issues | `list_issues` · `get_issue` · `create_issue` · `update_issue` · `bulk_update` · `edit_issue` · `get_board` |
| Relations | `link_issues` · `unlink_issues` |
| Pages | `get_page` · `create_page` · `update_page` · `edit_page` |

## When Lific is the wrong tool

Honesty is cheaper than churn:

- **You need enterprise team features.** No SSO/SAML, no sprints, no estimates, no roadmap gantt charts. If you're coordinating forty humans, use Linear or Plane.
- **You want issues as files in the repo.** Lific is a database with an API, not markdown-in-git. If you want `git diff` on your task list, a markdown-native tracker fits better.
- **You need distributed multi-writer sync.** One Lific instance is one SQLite file: a single source of truth that's trivially backed up, not a CRDT. Multiple agents talk to one server; the server doesn't merge with other servers.

For one human directing several agents across personal projects (the thing it's built for), none of those trade-offs bite.

## Authorization

Lific has project-scoped, default-deny authorization: viewer / maintainer / lead membership enforced on every REST and MCP call, including reads. **Fresh installs (created on 2.0+) enforce it by default; instances upgraded from an earlier version keep it off** until you opt in - nothing changes under you on upgrade. Toggle it at runtime:

```bash
lific instance set --authz-enforced true    # or false
```

With enforcement on, a newly created user sees nothing until they're granted membership. Manage access from the CLI (or the web UI's project members page):

```bash
lific member add --project LIF --user sam              # viewer by default
lific member add --all --user sam --role maintainer    # every project at once
lific member role -p LIF -u sam -r lead                # change a role
lific member remove -p LIF -u sam
lific member list --project LIF
```

Forgotten password? The operator can reset one from the shell (this signs out all of that user's sessions):

```bash
lific user set-password --username sam
```

**Auth can be turned off entirely for a private, local instance** with `required = false` under `[auth]` in `lific.toml`. Credential-less requests then get admin-equivalent access; a presented-but-invalid token still fails loudly. The web UI signs you in automatically as the first admin (the single-user auto-login flow) instead of showing a login form - if no account exists yet, the signup screen still appears so there's an identity to attribute work to. This is a config-file key on purpose (flipping it requires shell access, like minting an operator key), and it comes with guard rails: the server refuses to start if `server.public_url` points anywhere but localhost, and logs a prominent warning otherwise - the default bind is `0.0.0.0`, so keep an auth-less instance loopback-only or firewalled.

**Unbound API keys bypass authorization by design.** A key with no user binding - the one `lific start` auto-mints on a keyless DB, and the ones `lific key create` and `connect`'s fresh-install path produce - is *operator-trusted*: it can only be created by someone with shell access to the server, so it's treated as admin-equivalent even in enforced mode. That's what keeps the zero-user `init → start → connect` flow working with enforcement on. The threat the default guards against is a web-signup stranger's session/OAuth token, not the operator's own shell-minted key. Audit these keys any time with:

```bash
lific key list
```

Prefer per-tool **bot identities** (what `lific connect` mints when you have a user account) over unbound keys: a bot inherits its owner's project access and shows up in the audit log by name.

## Configuration

<details>
<summary><code>lific.toml</code></summary>

`lific init` generates this:

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 3456
cors_origins = []
trusted_proxies = ["127.0.0.0/8", "::1/128"]

[database]
path = "lific.db"

[backup]
enabled = true
dir = "backups"
interval_minutes = 60
retain = 24

[log]
level = "info"

[auth]
allow_signup = true
required = true
```

CLI flags (`--db`, `--port`, `--host`) override config values. Set `server.public_url` when exposing Lific beyond localhost; it becomes the OAuth issuer and the URL `lific connect` writes into client configs. `server.trusted_proxies` controls which peers may supply `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP`; it defaults to loopback for Tailscale Funnel. Add only proxy IPs/CIDRs you operate.

Config is discovered in standard locations, first match wins:

1. `--config <path>` (used alone, no fallback)
2. `./lific.toml` (current directory)
3. User config dir: `~/.config/lific/lific.toml` on Linux (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` respected), `~/Library/Application Support/lific/` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\lific\` on Windows
4. System config dir: `/etc/lific/lific.toml` on Linux/BSD, `/Library/Application Support/Lific/` on macOS, `%ProgramData%\lific\` on Windows

A relative `database.path` always resolves against the config file's own directory, so the same config works no matter where the process starts. `lific init --config /path/to/lific.toml` and `lific service install --config ...` root the whole instance (config, database, service working directory) at that path.

</details>

## Backup and restore

The data set is the database plus a content-addressed `attachments/` dir beside it. `lific dump` packages both into one self-contained archive, taking a consistent DB snapshot via `VACUUM INTO` that is safe while the server is running:

```bash
lific dump                      # → ./lific_20260703_141500.tar.gz
lific dump --out /mnt/backups   # directory → default filename inside it
```

Each archive contains the DB snapshot, every attachment blob, and a `manifest.json` (Lific version, schema version, sizes). Restoring is the mirror image. Stop the server first:

```bash
lific restore lific_20260703_141500.tar.gz          # refuses to overwrite an existing db
lific restore lific_20260703_141500.tar.gz --force  # moves the current db aside to lific.db.pre-restore-<ts>
```

Restores are staged (a failure leaves the original data dir untouched) and refuse archives created by a newer Lific; older archives are fine, and pending migrations apply on next start.

The automatic interval backups (`[backup]` in config) write the same `.tar.gz` artifact to the backup dir with rotation. External backup harnesses (restic, borg, cron) can either scoop up that dir or call `lific dump` as a pre-backup hook:

```bash
# e.g. restic pre-hook
lific dump --out /srv/backup-staging/lific.tar.gz && restic backup /srv/backup-staging
```

## Building from source

### Requirements

- **Rust 1.88+** required
- **Bun** optional, only needed if you want the web UI

SQLite is bundled via `rusqlite` and compiled into the binary. No system SQLite required.

### API-only build (no web UI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VoidNullable/lific
cd lific
mkdir -p web/dist
cargo build --release
```

The `mkdir -p web/dist` creates the empty directory that `rust-embed` expects at compile time. The resulting binary has full functionality (MCP, REST API, CLI, OAuth, backups) but visiting the web UI will return a message pointing you to build the frontend.

### Full build (with web UI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VoidNullable/lific
cd lific
cd web && bun install && bun run build && cd ..
cargo build --release
```

The frontend is a Svelte 5 SPA built with Vite. `bun run build` outputs static files to `web/dist/`, which `cargo build` embeds into the binary. The final binary is fully self-contained with no runtime dependencies.
