//! LIF-196: the single project-scoped authorization primitive shared by REST
//! (LIF-197) and MCP (LIF-198), so the two transports can't drift. Design:
//! LIF-DOC-7. Part of epic LIF-194.
//!
//! ## Two modes, one runtime flag
//!
//! Enforcement is gated by the instance setting `authz_enforced` (migration
//! 027, off by default — see [`db::queries::settings`]). This mirrors how
//! `web_auto_login` (LIF-215) and `allow_signup` (LIF-211) are read: a plain
//! column on the single `instance_settings` row, read fresh on every check so
//! flipping it takes effect without a restart.
//!
//! - **Flag off (legacy mode)** — reproduces today's behavior exactly:
//!   `min = Lead` runs the pre-LIF-194 `require_project_lead` check
//!   (`projects.lead_user_id`, plus the LIF-102 unowned-project carve-out);
//!   `min = Maintainer` / `min = Viewer` allow any request, authenticated or
//!   not. No new denials are introduced in this mode.
//! - **Flag on (default-deny mode)** — resolves the effective role from
//!   `project_members` and requires `role >= min`. A `None` auth user or a
//!   non-member is always `Forbidden`, even for `min = Viewer`.
//!
//! `is_admin` bypasses both modes unconditionally. Bots resolve to their
//! owner (`007_bot_owners.sql`) before either check runs, in both modes — an
//! agent can never exceed the human that owns it.
//!
//! ## Operator-key trust (LIF-261)
//!
//! Enforced mode is default-deny for a `None` effective user. That alone would
//! brick the zero-user agent-first flow (`lific init` → `start` → `connect`),
//! which runs on **user-unbound API keys** that resolve to `AuthUser = None`.
//! Those keys can only be minted with shell access to the server (`lific
//! start`'s first-run auto-key, `lific key create`, `connect`'s fresh-install
//! path), so they're operator-trusted by construction — the threat the default
//! guards against is a web-signup stranger with a session/OAuth token, not the
//! operator's own shell-minted key.
//!
//! So enforced mode treats an **unbound API key** as admin-equivalent. The
//! signal is credential-type-specific and comes only from the auth layer's
//! unbound-API-key path — it is deliberately NOT "any `None`," because a legacy
//! pre-binding OAuth token (`src/auth.rs`) also resolves to `None` and must
//! stay default-denied. The auth middleware sets [`operator_scope`] (REST) or
//! `mcp::with_request_user`'s operator flag (MCP); [`operator_context`] reads
//! whichever surface is active. **Unbound API keys therefore bypass authz by
//! design; audit them with `lific key list`.**
