//! Background sweep that empties the trash (LIF-438).
//!
//! Deleting an issue, page or comment leaves a tombstone: the row stays, with
//! `deleted_at` set, so a replica can sync the deletion and a user can undo
//! it. This task is what makes that bounded. Every `[retention] trash_days`
//! the sweep runs a real DELETE over anything past the window, which is also
//! the only moment the foreign-key cascades fire.
//!
//! Shape copied from `backup::start_backup_task`: settle, sweep once at
//! startup, then sweep on an interval, with the synchronous SQLite work handed
//! to the blocking pool and awaited so one sweep can never queue behind
//! another.
