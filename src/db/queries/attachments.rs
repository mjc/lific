//! LIF-262: attachment metadata + link bookkeeping.

//! Pure data access over the `attachments` / `attachment_links` tables

//! layer (`api::attachments`) owns byte storage (`crate::storage`) and the
//! project-role gate. Bytes are content-addressed on disk; a row here just
//! records the metadata and the `sha256` that points at the blob.
