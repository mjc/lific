//! LIF-439: delta backfill and cold-start bootstrap for a syncing client.
//!
//! Migration 045 gave issues, pages and comments one instance-wide monotonic
//! `seq`, and migration 047 made deletes leave a tombstone behind instead of
//! removing the row. Together they make "everything in this project above
//! seq N" a complete description of what a replica missed, deletions
//! included. This module is the read side of that.
//!
//! Two entry points:
//!
//!   * [`list_changes`] — the delta. Issues, pages and comments merged into
//!     one seq-ascending stream, tombstones included, paginated by a cursor
//!     that is just the last seq handed out.
//!   * [`get_index`] — the bootstrap. Live rows only, plus the cursor a
//!     client should resume [`list_changes`] from. See that function's doc
//!     comment for the ordering rule its correctness rests on.
//!
//! Every row is *skinny*: no issue description, no page content, no comment
//! body. A list view never needs them, and shipping them would make the
//! bootstrap proportional to the total prose in the project rather than to
//! the number of rows. Clients fetch bodies from the existing detail
//! endpoints on demand.
//!
//! The one concession is `preview`: the first non-empty line of an issue's
//! description or a page's content, capped at [`PREVIEW_CHARS`]. List rows
//! render one, and making a client fetch every body to draw a single line
//! would cost far more than the bounded string does. The body column is
//! read, reduced to that line, and dropped before serialization — it never
//! reaches the wire.
