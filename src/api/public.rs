//! LIF-465 / LIF-471: the anonymous read surface for a published project.
//!
//! A router of its own rather than routes added to [`super::router`], because
//! the separation is the boundary:
//!
//! * it is merged *after* `server::build_app` layers the auth middleware onto
//!   the authenticated router, so it is outside that middleware rather than
//!   carved out of it by path;
//! * it has no identity extension at all, so a handler here cannot consult
//!   `authz.rs` even by accident. That rules out the two shortcuts the
//!   contract forbids: turning auth off, and impersonating a Viewer;
//! * it registers only `get`, so every other method is a 405 from axum's own
//!   method router rather than from a dozen handlers remembering to check.
//!
//! ## The mirror rule (LIF-471)
//!
//! Every route here is a private route with `/api` replaced by
//! `/public/api/projects/{project}`, answering with the same JSON shape and
//! the same paging headers, minus what [`crate::db::queries::public`] scrubs.
//! That is what lets the web client run its ordinary components against this
//! surface with one path rewrite and no bearer token:
//!

//! Authorization is the `is_public = 1` predicate plus project ownership

//! Caching is off everywhere: a published project can be unpublished, and a
//! cached response would outlive that decision.
