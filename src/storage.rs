//! LIF-262: content-addressed file storage for attachments.
//!
//! Raw bytes never touch SQLite. Each uploaded blob is written to
//! `<data_dir>/attachments/<sha256>`, where `<data_dir>` is the directory
//! containing the database file (see [`AttachmentStore::from_db_path`]). The
//! file name IS the content hash, so identical bytes uploaded twice collapse
//! onto one file — deduplication is a property of the layout, not extra code.
//!
//! The DB's `attachments` table holds the metadata (filename, mime, uploader,
//! size) and points at a blob via its `sha256`. Because the store is
//! content-addressed, writes are idempotent: re-writing an already-present
//! hash is a cheap no-op, and a delete only removes the sidecar file once the
//! caller has confirmed no `attachments` row still references that hash (the
//! orphan GC's job — see `db::queries::attachments`).
