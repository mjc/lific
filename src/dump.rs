//! LIF-266: backup as an interface — `lific dump` / `lific restore`.
//!
//! The data set is no longer a single file. Since attachments (LIF-262) it is
//! `lific.db` plus a content-addressed `attachments/` sidecar dir living beside
//! it (blobs named by their sha256; in-progress writes carry a `.tmp`
//! extension — see [`crate::storage`]). A DB snapshot alone would restore
//! metadata rows pointing at missing blobs.
//!
//! This module follows the `gitea dump` pattern: one command produces one
//! self-contained, timestamped `lific_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz` archive with
//! everything needed to restore — the DB, every attachment blob, and a
//! `manifest.json` describing what's inside. [`restore`] validates and unpacks
//! it back into a data dir. The interval backup task (`src/backup.rs`) emits
//! the *same* artifact via [`write_dump`], so there is exactly one backup shape.
