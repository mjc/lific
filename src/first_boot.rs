//! First boot for a container: `lific start --init-if-missing` (LIF-468).
//!
//! A container image has no interactive `lific init` step. The image starts,
//! the mounted volume is empty, and `start` refuses because only `init`
//! creates a database. This module is the narrow exception to that rule, and
//! it is deliberately more suspicious than `init` is:
//!
//! - it only ever runs when the operator typed `--init-if-missing`,
//! - it refuses unless the database location was chosen on purpose (an
//!   explicit `--config`/`--db`, or a config file that was actually found),
//!   so the flag can never conjure a stray `lific.db` in whatever directory
//!   the process happened to start in,
//! - it refuses to create the parent directory, because a missing mount point
//!   is the normal shape of a misconfigured volume and silently writing into
//!   the container's ephemeral filesystem loses the operator's data on the
//!   next restart,
//! - it never mints the unbound "default" API key. `init` does that in the
//!   operator's own terminal where they can read it; here stdout is a
//!   container log, which is the wrong place for an operator credential.
//!   Creating the admin is what prevents it: `auth::should_mint_initial_key`
//!   is false the moment a human operator exists.
//!
//! **Creating a database requires both admin environment variables.** An
//! instance that boots with zero users is not a neutral starting state: signup
//! would be open, whoever loads the page first becomes the admin, and
//! `lific start` would mint and print an unbound operator key into the
//! container log. So a fresh database is created only when there is an admin to
//! put in it. An *existing* database ignores the variables, except for the one
//! case below.
//!
//! **The seeding is one immediate transaction, and the admin is its own
//! completion marker.** Creating the database and seeding it cannot be a single
//! atomic step (the file has to exist and be migrated before anything can be
//! written to it), so a crash in between leaves a migrated database with no
//! users. The next `--init-if-missing` start finds that and finishes the job
//! rather than treating "the file exists" as "the instance is set up". A
//! separate marker row would add nothing: it could only ever be written in the
//! same transaction as the admin, so "no marker" and "no human admin" are the
//! same fact. Two starters racing serialize on the immediate transaction, and
//! the loser sees the admin and does nothing.
